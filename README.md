# Note: This is a Prototype with rudimentary mechanics as this is an ongoing project.
## game type: 2D / Terraria | Celeste inspired

a rhythmic bullet hell with a focus on intense boss fights and satisfying gunplay. The art style blends the retro pixel aesthetic of Celeste
with the sharp, futuristic feel of Electricman. The game is set in a decaying virtual reality, where you play as a character with Doomslayerlike power, but who is also blind and trapped. The narrative is a psychological journey into a twisted, virtual world inspired by the short
story, "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream."

The core gameplay loop involves navigating visually striking levels culminating in challenging, rhythmic boss battles. Player movement is
key, with a Celeste-like dash and a Jetpack Joyride-style jetpack at the center of the mechanics. Each boss fight is a spectacle, and
defeating a boss rewards you with a unique weapon directly tied to their identity and abilities, similar to the boss weapons in Elden Ring.

## Visuals and Art Style
The art style is a fusion of Celeste and Electricman. Think detailed pixel art with vibrant, glowing colors that pop against darker,
industrial backdrops.

Animated backgrounds: The levels themselves are alive, with subtle movements, glowing effects, and a sense of rhythm that mirrors the music.

## Industrial tracks
The soundtrack is the backbone of the game, consisting of hard-hitting industrial and electronic music. Bullet patterns and enemy attacks
are synchronized to the beat.

## Player character
A powerful, armored figure with a visor that hints at their blindness like a blindfold, and an aesthetic that blends the rugged look of a
Doomslayer with the sleekness of Electricman.
Levels and Bosses

The game is structured as a series of distinct levels, each with its own theme, enemies, and a final boss.
